# Issues and Suggestions

This repository is deprecated. This was for issues and suggestions on the V1 API. You can post any new issues directly on the V2 API docs here: https://github.com/SpaceTradersAPI/api-docs

This repository is a place for *users* of the
[SpaceTradersAPI](https://spacetraders.io/). It's the place to goto if you're
experiencing a bug or have an idea for a new feature you'd want to see
implemented. In any of these cases first check if there's already an issue
created for it. You can add extra information to the existing issue or just
react to it letting the developers get an indication of how to prioritize
handling the issues.
